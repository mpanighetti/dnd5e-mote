# Norgrad Canal

**Norgrad Canal** is an artificial river that feeds from the [Esterfell Sea](esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md) to the oceans north of [Esterfell](../esterfell.md). The flow of water is controlled by a dam and levee operated by the city of [Norgrad](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/norgrad.md), allowing for sailing ships to transit between the ocean and inland sea for commerce.
