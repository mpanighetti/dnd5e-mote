# Westin Island

**Westin Island** is a small body of land on the western edge of the [Esterfell Sea](index.md). The settlement of [Bridgeport](../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/bridgeport/) was built on the island to act as a midpoint for the [Bridge of Commerce](../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/road-of-commerce.md).
