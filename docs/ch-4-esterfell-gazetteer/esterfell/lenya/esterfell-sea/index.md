# Esterfell Sea

The **Esterfell Sea** is a vast freshwater inland sea in [Lenya](../). It is the impact site of a [starstuff](../../../../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md) asteroid in prehistory which shaped most of [Esterfell](../../)'s modern features.

The islands are labeled with their names and are listed here from left to right: Kashio Island, arrowhead-shaped along the western sea, containing the city of Bridgeport, with two bridges and two shipp routes connecting it to the shore and other ports; The Scattered, a large archipelago roughly in the center of the sea made of multiple small unsettled islands; and Deepfield Island, a comma-shaped island with some elevation, and the single settlement of Doria connected via ship routes to Mina on the shore and other settlements across the sea." />
