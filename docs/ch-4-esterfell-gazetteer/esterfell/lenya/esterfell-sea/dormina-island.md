# Dormina Island

**Dormina Island** is one of the largest islands in the [Esterfell Sea](index.md), situated along its eastern coast. The town of [Doria](../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/doria.md) sits at the southern tip of Dormina.

## History

The island is named after the distant kingdom of [Dormina](../../../other-lands-of-mote.md#dormina), and its settlement Doria and sister city [Mina](../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/mina.md) reflect the two separate kingdoms of the same name which were united in ancient times.
