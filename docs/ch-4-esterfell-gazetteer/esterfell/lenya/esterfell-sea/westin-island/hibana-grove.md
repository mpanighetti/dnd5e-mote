# Hibana Grove

**Hibana Grove** is a small forest on [Westin Island](index.md). Its closest settlement is [Ashín](../../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/ashin/).

## History

In the centuries before the forest was discovered by intelligent beings, Hibana Grove had periodic naturally-occurring wildfires which promoted new tree growth in the wake of the destruction. This led to eventual settlers giving the forest its name, in reference to the risk of campfire sparks quickly setting the forest's trees ablaze.

Since Ashín was settled in 142 AP, the local population has attempted to prevent the forest fires to protect their land and livelihoods, but has made no effort to clean up overgrowth via controlled burns. As a result, the forest is at risk of uncontrolled wildfires which might also one day endanger the people of Ashín.

### Etymology

The forest's name comes from a pre-[Esterfell](../../) human language (火花) and means "spark".
