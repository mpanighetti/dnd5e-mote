# Westin Island

**Westin Island** is a small body of land on the western edge of the [Esterfell Sea](../). It acts as a midpoint for the [Bridge of Commerce](../../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/road-of-commerce.md) as well as a port of call for accessing its various settlements.
