# Westin Island

**Westin Island** is a small body of land on the western edge of the [Esterfell Sea](../). The settlement of [Bridgeport](../../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/bridgeport/) was built on the island to act as a midpoint for the [Bridge of Commerce](../../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/road-of-commerce.md), with [Ashín](../../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/ashin/) and [Zutto](../../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/zutto/) serving as smaller settlements and ports.
