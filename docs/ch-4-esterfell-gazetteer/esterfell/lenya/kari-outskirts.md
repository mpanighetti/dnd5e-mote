# Kari Outskirts

The **Kari Outskirts** are comprised of broad prairie lands and tundra south of the [Floral Divide](floral-divide.md).

## Settlements

Most of the land known as the Kari Outskirts officially falls under the domain of [Subros](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/subros/), but much of it remains undeveloped with no permanent Subrosian presence, leaving it to be broadly considered [Verdancy](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/verdancy/) territory. [Redgrave](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/redgrave.md) is the only [Esterfell Accord](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/) city in this region.
