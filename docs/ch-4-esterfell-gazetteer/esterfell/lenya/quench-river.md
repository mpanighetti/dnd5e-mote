# Quench River

**Quench River** is an outflowing stream from [Esterfell Sea](esterfell-sea/) that empties into the [Great Seam](great-seam.md).

## History

The Great Seam was carved out by an ancient river over millions of years, but that water source was snuffed out when a [starstuff](../../../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md) asteroid slammed into [Esterfell](../) and reshaped the continent. As the Esterfell Sea formed in the massive crater, a new river was formed that immediately flowed into the Great Seam's western canyon. After awakened beings immigrated to [Lenya](index.md), they called the river Quench, as it was thought that the Great Seam extended all the way to the Hells and that the waters of the Sea drowned out any demons that would otherwise emerge and sow chaos throughout the world.
