# Coasts of Esterfell

## Strait of Shallows

The **Strait of Shallows** is a channel dividing [Lenya](../lenya/) from [Malagwa](../malagwa.md) and [Barria](../barria.md) along the western side of [Esterfell](../). Ships of the [Esterfell Accord](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/) use the Strait for commerce between [Perlipont](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/perlipont.md) and [Barrinview](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/barrinview.md) in order to avoid taking the more treacherous paths of the [Attalya Mountains](../lenya/attalya-mountains/) by foot or horse.
