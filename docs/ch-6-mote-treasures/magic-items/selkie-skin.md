# Selkie Skin

_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

A selkie transforms into their person form by literally shedding the skin of their seal form, and likewise dons the skin again to become a seal. When another creature comes into possession of such a skin, they become the sole fixation of the selkie through a magical charming effect.

To the casual observer, this item looks identical to the pelt of a [Malagwan seal](../../ch-7-mote-bestiary/malagwan-seal.md), but it is in fact the skin of a [selkie](../../ch-5-character-options/species/selkie/) who has doffed their seal form. The skin can be destroyed either by dealing damage to it (AC 11, 3 Hit Points) or if it is ever on a separate plane of existence from the selkie.

While you possess this Selkie Skin, the selkie from which the skin was acquired is charmed by you and has the Charmed condition until you no longer possess it; no spell or other effect can end the Charmed condition caused by this skin.
