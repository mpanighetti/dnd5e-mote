### Porting

The Academerie maintains a permanent teleportation circle deep within its walls to act as a means of quick travel around the [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/) continent. A porter is employed there to cast the _Teleportation Circle_ spell for one or more travelers, at a cost of 10 GP per traveler, or 55 GP for a single group.

The porter has sigils linking to teleportation circles in the following [Esterfell Accord](../../societies/esterfell-accord/) locations:

- [Cape Bec](../../societies/esterfell-accord/cape-bec/)
- [Cape Luz](../../societies/esterfell-accord/cape-luz.md)
- [Dunkel](../../societies/esterfell-accord/dunkel.md)
- [Fleuderton](../../societies/esterfell-accord/fleuderton/)
- [Overseam](../../societies/esterfell-accord/overseam.md)
