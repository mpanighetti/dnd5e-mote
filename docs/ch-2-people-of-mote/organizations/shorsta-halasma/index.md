# Shorsta-Halasma

The **Shorsta-Halasma** are an order of monks endeavoring to unlock the secrets of planar psionics. Each teacher and student learns to mentally connect to a specific realm, then channels that planar energy through their ki using a [staff of Shorsta](../../../ch-6-mote-treasures/magic-items/staff-of-shorsta.md). Their monastery is hidden deep within the [Eastern Forests](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/lenya/eastern-forests.md).

## History

Among the first folk who set foot on the shores of [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/) were two elves, Shorsta and Halasma. They were driven by divine influence to seek out lands touched by [starstuff](../../../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md) and found a monastery there dedicated to the study of planar psionics. The two monks had discovered that a person could, with sufficient training and mental discipline, activate starstuff's magical ability to create [waypoints](../../../ch-3-stories-of-mote/waypoints.md) and mentally connect to other planes of existence, then tap into extraplanar energies to augment their own abilities. They eventually settled deep in the Eastern Forests and began recruiting candidates to teach both this mysterious art and how to construct staffs with starstuff shards that could aid the students in channeling planar energies.

Over the millennia, the monastery has gradually succeeded its founders with former students who pass on the secrets of planar psionics to future generations, and it maintains a group of carefully selected acolytes to this day.
