## History

A splinter group of humans left [Lenya](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/lenya.md) shortly after arriving in [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell.md) and came to [Barria](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/barria.md) to escape rule by the [Esterfell Accord](../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md). Calling their religious order The Chosen, these humans built a new society founded under strict religious rule, uniting their citizens in worship of a single deity: a deva named Ramil.

## Beliefs

### Champion

Around once per century, a child is born amongst the Ramilan people who possesses an innate connection to Ramil. This gifted being, an aasimar known to the Chosen as the Ramilon, is trained to hone the divine spark within them to serve as Ramil's champion.
