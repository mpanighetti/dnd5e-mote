# Mina

**Mina** is a fishing town on the east coast of the [Esterfell Sea](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md). It acts as a midpoint for both ships sailing alongside the coast and caravans traveling along the eastern stretch of the [Road of Commerce](road-of-commerce.md) between [Seaspire](seaspire.md) and [Lombo](lombo.md), and it is considered the sister city of [Doria](doria.md).
