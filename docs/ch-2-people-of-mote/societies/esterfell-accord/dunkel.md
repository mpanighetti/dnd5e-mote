# Dunkel

**Dunkel** is a small town to the west of the [Floral Divide](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/lenya/floral-divide.md) and south of [Frostenfeld](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/lenya/frostenfeld.md). It is currently considered part of the [Esterfell Accord](index.md), but the region has switched hands numerous times over the centuries and was under control of [Subros](../subros/) until a few decades ago.
