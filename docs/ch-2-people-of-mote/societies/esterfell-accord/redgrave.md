# Redgrave

**Redgrave** is a small outpost in the [Kari Outskirts](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/lenya/kari-outskirts.md). It is the only [Esterfell Accord](index.md) settlement south of the [Floral Divide](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/lenya/floral-divide.md), and often acts as a point of contact between the Accord and [Subros](../subros/).
