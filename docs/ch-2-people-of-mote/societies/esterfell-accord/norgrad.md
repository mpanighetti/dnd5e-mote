# Norgrad

**Norgrad** is a city that sits atop the northern coast of the [Esterfell Sea](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/lenya/esterfell-sea/). The city operates a dam and levee that regulates the flow of water from the Esterfell Sea to the open ocean north of [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/), by way of the artificially created [Norgrad Canal](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/lenya/norgrad-canal.md).
