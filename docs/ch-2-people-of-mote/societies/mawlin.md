# Mawlin

**Mawlin** is a territory covering most of the island of [Barria](../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/barria.md). It has few standing settlements, instead consisting of multiple nomadic tribes that traverse the desert. These tribes maintain an uneasy coexistence with the territory of [Ramila](ramila.md).

## Information

- **Demonyms:** Mawlin

## Demographics

The Mawlin tribes consist largely of species adapted to persist or thrive within the hot arid climate of Barria, including the following:

- Dragonborn (red and blue)
- [Desert dwarf](../ch-5-character-options/species/dwarf.md#desert-dwarf)
- Genasi (fire and earth)
- [Dust gnome](../ch-5-character-options/species/gnome.md#dust-gnome)
- Lizardfolk
- Loxodon
- Thri-kreen
- Tiefling

But prior ancestry is not a strict requirement of living with the Mawlin, and many wanderers from across [Esterfell](../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/) might find themselves adopted into the tribes, including humans banished by [The Chosen](../ch-2-people-of-mote/organizations/the-chosen/) and left to fend for themselves in the harsh stretches of deserts.
