# Pescan

**Pescans** are intelligent fishfolk found in the oceans across [Mote](../../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/mote.md).

## Description

Though their faces and torsos are superficially similar to those of humans, pescans display aspects of fish across the rest of their bodies. They have webbed hands and gills on their necks, with blue and green coloration on their scaly skin. Individuals run a spectrum of fishlike appearance: some are bipedal to allow for improved land travel, while others possess long muscular tails comprising the lower halves of their bodies, granting them fast movement in water at the expense of a limited mobility on land.

## History

These aquatic beings originally hail from the Elemental Plane of Water. Many pescans found their way to Mote through naturally occurring [waypoints](../../../ch-3-stories-of-mote/watpoints.md), immigrating to the world and settling its vast oceans in waves over thousands of years.

## Distribution

Pescans were technically among the earliest immigrants to the continent of [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/), mostly settling on the continental shelf to its north. Eventually they, along with other peaceful seafaring folks, called their growing nation [Xiahulia](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/xiahulia.md), and it is where most pescans are found today.

Some pescans have wandered inland to the [Esterfell Accord](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/), though their dependence on seawater meant they could never make significant inroads to the inland regions, resulting in most Accord pescans being found in coastal towns such as [Cape Bec](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/cape-bec/), [Cape Luz](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/cape-luz.md), and [Suizenloch](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/suizenloch.md).
