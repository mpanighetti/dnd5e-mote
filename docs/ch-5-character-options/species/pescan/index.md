# Pescan

**Pescans** are intelligent fishfolk hailing from the northern oceans of [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/).

## Distribution

Pescans were technically among the earliest immigrants to the continent of Esterfell, mostly settling on the continental shelf to its north. Eventually they, along with other peaceful seafaring folks, called their growing nation [Xiahulia](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/xiahulia.md), and it is where most pescans are found today.

Some pescans have wandered inland to the [Esterfell Accord](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/), though their dependence on seawater meant they could never make significant inroads to the inland regions, resulting in most Accord pescans being found in coastal towns such as [Cape Bec](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/cape-bec/), [Cape Luz](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/cape-luz.md), and [Suizenloch](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/suizenloch.md).
