# [Brakko](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-species/blob/main/monstrosities/brakko.md)

**Brakko** are intelligent aquatic beings residing in the deepest [waters](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/coasts-of-esterfell) surrounding [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/).

## Distribution

Brakko schools came upon Esterfell in the last few centuries. They tend to avoid the land-bound societies of the continent, and they get in regular quarrels with the people of [Xiahulia](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/xiahulia.md) over resources and territory. Though some brakko embraced the larger established society and now consider themselves Xiahuli, many maintained their older tribal and familial affiliations and bristle at the thought of unifying with what they see as lesser beings. Most folk consider the deeper waters of southern Esterfell to be firmly brakko territory, as the pressure of the depths makes it difficult for the Xiahuli to build permanent structures there.

As a brakko, you have the following special traits.

_**Amphibious.**_ You can breathe air and water.

_**Bite.**_ You have a fanged maw that you can use to make Unarmed Strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier Piercing damage, instead of the Bludgeoning damage normal for an Unarmed Strike.

_**Charge.**_ If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit them with your Bite attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 Piercing damage, and if the target is a creature of the same Size as you or smaller, they are caught in your mouth and have the Grappled condition. While a creature is Grappled in this manner, your Swim Speed is not halved due to dragging or carrying the creature, and you cannot attempt to grapple another creature with your Bite.

_**Depth Strider.**_ Adapted to the frigid ocean depths, you have Resistance to Cold damage.
