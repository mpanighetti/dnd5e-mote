# Species

A diverse assortment of peoples dwell among the island continents of [Mote](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/mote.md). This section presents information about the modern inhabitants of [Esterfell](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/) and contextualizes the species from the _SRD_ within the world of Mote.

Note that species found in modern Esterfell are not monocultures; though similar physical traits are shared within a species, and some species can be found in tightknit clusters based on familial relations or comfort within a given biome, the [societies of Esterfell](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/) are largely melting pots composed of members of multiple species. For more information on species distribution in specific regions across Mote, see [Chapter 2: People of Mote](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/).

In addition to the species found in the _SRD_, Mote is home to many other species, including the following:

**[Brakko](brakko/)** are carnivorous hunters who reside in the deep trenches of the northern oceans of Esterfell. While some have integrated with the [Xiahuli](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/xiahulia.md), others form loose familial bands that hunt the depths for prey and aggressively defend their territories.

**[Ceteans](cetean/)** are nomadic beings who flew amongst the stars of [Fellspace](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/fellspace.md) in ancient times, with some pods eventually settling in the oceans of Mote but maintaining a distant connection to their stellar kin.

**[Pescans](pescan/)** are aquatic people

**[Selkie](selkie/)** are therianthropes who comfortably shift between humanoid and seal forms and their respective land and sea domains, residing primarily along the northern and eastern coasts of Esterfell.

**[Sparks](spark.md)** are artificial beings, born of Accord mages and tinkerers who channeled [starstuff](../../) energy to create new souls tethered to mechanical bodies. They are a young populace, with no cultural history and a future full of potential.

Descriptions of species found in the _SRD_ are found below; some of these species have new options not found in the _SRD_:

**Dragonborn** are descendants of ancient dragons. Their scales reflect this ancestry, presenting a wide variety of coloration based on which dragons led to their modern lineages. A few prominent dragonborn families were among the earliest investors in the Atæron Mining Consortium back in the old world, sailing from [Atæros](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/other-lands-of-mote.md#atros) to look for future investments. Their descendants have largely forgotten this business association after several generations, but on the books they are still considered AMC stockholders.

**[Dwarves](dwarf.md)** are

**Elves** are

**[Gnomes](gnome.md)** are

**Goliaths** are

**Halflings** are

**Humans** on Mote are similar to those found on other worlds: adaptable, ambitious, and diverse.

**Orcs** are

**Tieflings** are

Some species options outside of the _SRD_ can also be found on Mote. They might exist in smaller pockets hidden from the outside world, or they could be visitors from other worlds, such as the Feywild. As a general rule, a species that has been designated as being "of the multiverse", such that they can be found on many worlds, also exists in Mote as a playable option. How that character fits into a campaign or adventure set in Esterfell should be discussed with the Game Master.


A diverse assortment of peoples dwell among the island continents of Mote. Aside from humans, the races in the Player’s Handbook are unknown on Theros, unless they’re visiting from other worlds.

This chapter provides information about the following common playable species of Mote.  as well as racial traits for all of them except humans:

Humans on Theros are similar to those found on other D&D worlds: adaptable, ambitious, and wildly diverse.

Centaurs employ cunning and equine strength to further the goals of the roaming Lagonna and Pheres bands.

Leonin are proud lion-like hunters, many of whom live in defiance of the gods.

Minotaurs are infamous for bloodthirstiness, a reputation even the most peaceful struggle to escape.

Satyrs follow their passions in the pursuit of wild revels and new adventures.

Tritons are an enigmatic, sea-dwelling people with an endless desire to explore.
