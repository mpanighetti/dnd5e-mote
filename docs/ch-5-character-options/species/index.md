# Species

A diverse assortment of peoples dwell among the island continents of [Mote](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/mote.md). This section presents information about the modern inhabitants of [Esterfell](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/), describes several species originating from Mote, and contextualizes the species from the _SRD_ within the world of Mote.

Note that species found in modern Esterfell are not monocultures; though similar physical traits are shared within a species, and some species can be found in tight-knit clusters based on familial relations or comfort within a given biome, Esterfell societies are largely melting pots composed of members of multiple species. For more information on species distribution in specific regions across Mote, see [People of Mote](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/) and [Societies of Esterfell](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/) in Chapter 2.

## Mote species

Descriptions of the most common species on Mote are found below.

**[Brakko](brakko/)** are carnivorous hunters who reside in the deep trenches of the northern oceans of Esterfell. While some have integrated with the [Xiahuli](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/xiahulia.md), others form loose familial bands that hunt the depths for prey and aggressively defend their territories. These depth-born societies have successfully prevented Xiahulia from staking claims beyond their continental shelf to the north.

**[Ceteans](cetean/)** are nomadic beings who flew amongst the stars of [Fellspace](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/fellspace.md) in ancient times. Though many cetean pods remained in space, some eventually settled in the oceans of Mote and aided in founding the underwater nation of Xiahulia. These oceanic ceteans maintain a distant connection to their stellar kin through a collective whalesong that permates Fellspace and the Astral Plane, allowing all ceteans to share their life experiences in a collective consciousness and shared memory.

**[Pescans](pescan/)** are aquatic people with piscine features found in oceans across Mote. Though their amphibious nature allows some access to the land, pescans are more comfortable when submerged in liquid, allowing them to quickly dart through the water and avoid drying out. This leads to few individual pescans being found on the land of Esterfell beyond brief encounters along its coasts, but the aquatic nation of Xiahulia counts most pescans as citizens.

**[Selkie](selkie/)** are therianthropes who comfortably shift between humanoid and seal forms. They reside primarily along the northern and eastern coasts of Esterfell, but being equally at home in the domains of land and sea means that selkie can be found scattered across the continent. They will sometimes conceal their true nature from the terrestrial societies they occupy, leading to them often going completely unnoticed amidst humanoids of coastal towns.

**[Sparks](spark.md)** are artificial beings, born of [Accord](../../ch-2-peopole-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/) mages and tinkerers who channeled [starstuff](../../) energy to create new souls tethered to mechanical bodies. As recent creations, they are a young and small populace with no cultural history, but this blank slate grants them a future full of potential as they discover their place in the world. Despite their uncertain destinies and constructed nature, as starstuff-born beings, sparks are as much a part of Mote as any other living creatures found there.

**Dragonborn** are descendants of ancient dragons. Their scales reflect this ancestry, presenting a wide variety of coloration based on which dragons led to their modern lineages. A few prominent dragonborn families were among the earliest investors in the Atæron Mining Consortium back in the old world, sailing from [Atæros](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/other-lands-of-mote.md#atros) to look for future investments. Their descendants have largely forgotten this business association after several generations, but on the books they are still considered AMC stockholders.

**[Dwarves](dwarf.md)** are stout humanoids with a hearty constitution, an abundance of facial hair, and an innate affinity for digging. This connection to earth and stone leads to many dwarves being found on and in the mountains of Mote, mining precious gems and metals to bring topside for trade. Many dwarves hired as minurs for the Atæron Mining Consortium were sent out on the early sailing ships to help set up shop elsewhere and expand their imperial reach, but those who arrived in Esterfell were captivated by the new land's bounty of natural resources and opted to sever their ties while they settled on the new continent.

**Elves** are the longest-lived species on Mote. This gives them broader individual perspectives, which are further aided by a subtle connection to a magical consciousness shared by all with elven ancestry during their nightly trances. Elves originally came to Mote from the Feywild through the earliest [waypoints](../../ch-3-stories-of-mote/waypoints.md) to manifest between those realms, drawn by curiosity and eventually reshaped by the Material Plane to the forms seen today. They are as diverse as the planes of existence, taking on unique appearances and personalities in every realm they are found in, while retaining both their distinct pointed ears and a demeanor informed by millennia of shared experience.

**[Gnomes](gnome.md)** are

**Goliaths** are

**Halflings** are

**Humans** on Mote are similar to those found on other worlds: adaptable, diverse, and filled with a perpetual desire to explore. Humans have tended to find comfortable niches to occupy wherever they land, often adding diversity to early historical monocultures when they settled down and had children within these societies. In this manner, humans helped bridge many ancient societies, and were some of the strongest proponents for ratifying the Esterfell Accord. Humans can be found in practically every settlement in every society and nation on Esterfell.

**Orcs** are

**Tieflings** are

## Additional options

Many other species can be found on Mote. Some might exist in smaller pockets hidden from the outside world, while others could be visitors from other worlds, such as the Feywild. As a general rule, a species that has been designated as being setting-agnostic or "of the multiverse", such that it can be found on many worlds, also exists on Mote as a playable option. How that character fits into a campaign or adventure set in Esterfell should be discussed with the Game Master.
