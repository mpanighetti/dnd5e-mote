# Mote Pantheons

The **Mote pantheons** are multiple collections of beings of power from across the multiverse. [Mote](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/mote.md) does not possess a singular pantheon, and each domain is not resided over by only a single god. Instead, an innate magical field powered by the [starstuff](../../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md) that permeates all the worlds of [Fellspace](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/fellspace.md) acts as both divine amplifier and limiter, causing the collective belief of a deity's followers to be their only means of claiming and holding onto a domain.

The term "god" is often used interchangeably on Mote with beings of "lesser" power, including archfey, celestial beings such as angels, fiends, and kuo-toan protogods. The origin of such beings has little bearing on their capability to ascend to godhood, as long as they carry a sufficient volume of collective worship.

## Ancient Mote Pantheon

The people of [Esterfell](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell/) are descended from immigrants who traveled to the continent from distant now-forgotten lands. These groups had their own collections of deities, and though not all of them are now worshipped to the same degree as in antiquity, they survive in Esterfell cultures through the names of months in the [Kivan calendar](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/timekeeping.md#kivan) and some smaller religious observations.

## Esterfell Pantheon

As Esterfell formed a melting pot of new alliances separated from their historical societal boundaries, new gods also came into being, either as composites of old deities or from entities rising into power through collective worship.

The **Deities of Esterfell** table is a non-exhaustive list of beings with power and influence over Esterfell, representing some specific groups of entities that have been granted full or partial deification by various groups.

## Borrowed Pantheon

On occasion, deities sourced from entirely different worlds became honorary Esterfell gods, though how they entered the public consciousness to a significant enough degree to find worshippers in a new world is not always well-understood.

The **Deities of the Multiverse** table is a non-exhaustive list of beings of power sourced from other worlds. The table calls out their origins in the **Pantheon** column.
