# README

This project is a repository of information about Mote, a Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition setting where most of my home games take place.

See https://mpanighetti.github.io/dnd5e-mote for a published browsable webpage. This repository is a GitHub-managed version of the published page. Feel free to contribute issues or pull requests for any issues you find on the site.
