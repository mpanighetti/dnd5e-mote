## History

Contrary to the name of the inn, the Glittering Seaview doesn't actually have a view of the ocean. This is a common false claim with cheaper Cape Bec taverns, as actual seaside real estate can be prohibitively expensive. In truth, the tavern is located on a cobblestone street on the southern end of Cape Bec's artificial island, nestled between multiple larger buildings.

## Expenses

Travelers can spend the equivalent of a modest or lower lifestyle to stay at the Glittering Seaview.
