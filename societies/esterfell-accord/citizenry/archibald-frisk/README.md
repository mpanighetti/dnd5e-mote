# Archibald Frisk

**Archibald Frisk** is an independent merchant (use the _noble_ stat block) with a hand in small business ventures across the [Esterfell Accord](../../../). He often acts as a wandering clothier offering fine articles of clothing colored with [murexian dye](../../../../artifacts/murex/murexian-dye.md).

## Business ventures

Archibald specializes in clothing suitable for attending galas, royal summits, and other formal occasions. The articles are all a bright purple, said to be dyed with [murex](../../../../artifacts/murex/murex.md) and costing 50gp apiece. This is a high markup for fine clothing, but a steal for genuine murexian hues. Unfortunately for Archibald's customers, Archibald has had some difficulty obtaining sufficient murex to dye his articles, and thus has occasionally resorted to faking the effect with purple grape juice.

> [!TIP]
> 🎲 Potential buyers can identify Archibald's faked murexian dye with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by his Charisma (Deception).

Frisk also recently came into ownership of a group of apartments in [Cape Bec](../../cape-bec), in a building called [The Dunes](../../cape-bec/the-dunes). He acquired the building cheaply in a public auction and thus has little desire to turn a huge profit from it, instead allowing his tenants to reside there in exchange for odd jobs.

Archibald is looking for capable adventurers to help him build out his murexian clothing business. He will hire such sell-swords for various tasks, from simple courier supply runs to dangerous expeditions into the [Murexian Grove](../../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/murexian-grove) to get him access to rare murex.
