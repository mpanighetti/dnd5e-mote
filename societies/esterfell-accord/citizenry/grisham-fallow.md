## History

Grisham was born to human parents, but divine influences from prior generations awakened the spark of Mount Celestia in him, making him an aasimar. This divine connection was unknown to his family and did not manifest any noticeable qualities in him until adulthood, when he discovered the ability to manifest angelic wings in times of strife. He has been able to conceal this divine connection in his day-to-day life.
