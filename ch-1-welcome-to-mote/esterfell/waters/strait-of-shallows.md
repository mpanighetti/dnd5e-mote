# Strait of Shallows

The **Strait of Shallows** is a channel dividing [Lenya](../lenya/lenya.md) from [Malagwa](../malagwa.md) and [Barria](../barria.md) along the western side of [Esterfell](../esterfell.md). Ships of the [Esterfell Accord](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) use the Strait to travel between [Perlipont](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/perlipont.md) and [Barrincress](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/barrincress.md) to avoid the more treacherous paths of the [Attalya Mountains](../lenya/attalya-mountains/attalya-mountains.md).
