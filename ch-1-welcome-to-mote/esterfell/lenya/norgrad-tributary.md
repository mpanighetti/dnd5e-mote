# Norgrad Tributary

**Norgrad Tributary** is an artificial river that feeds from the oceans north of [Esterfell](../esterfell.md) into the [Esterfell Sea](esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md). The flow of water is controlled by a dam and levee operated by the city of [Norgrad](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/norgrad.md).
