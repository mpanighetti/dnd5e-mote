# Kari Outskirts

The **Kari Outskirts** are comprised of broad prairie lands and tundra south of the [Floral Divide](floral-divide.md).

## Settlements

Most of the land known as the Kari Outskirts officially falls under the domain of [Subros](../../../societies/subros.md), but much of it remains undeveloped with no permanent Subrosian presence, leaving it to be broadly considered [Verdancy](../../../societies/verdancy/verdancy.md) territory. [Redgrave](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/redgrave.md) is the only [Esterfell Accord](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) city in this region.
