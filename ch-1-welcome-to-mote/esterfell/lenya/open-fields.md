# Open Fields

The **Open Fields** are a verdant expanse of grasslands between the [Esterfell Sea](esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md) and the [Floral Divide](floral-divide.md). They generally mark the southern region of the [Esterfell Accord](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md), with the [Road of Commerce](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/road-of-commerce.md) along its northern edge connecting multiple Accord settlements.
