# Esterfell Sea

The **Esterfell Sea** is a vast body of water in [Lenya](../lenya.md). It is the impact site of a [starstuff](../../../../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md) asteroid in prehistory which shaped most of [Esterfell](../../esterfell.md)'s modern features.

## Geography

The Esterfell Sea has several islands: in addition to [Cassiopeia Island](cassiopeia-island.md) and [Deepfield Island](deepfield-island.md), an archipelago known as [The Scattered](the-scattered.md) marks the rough center of the sea.

## Rivers

Esterfell Sea is fed by [TillÃ« Falls](../attalya-mountains/tille-peak/tille-falls.md) and the [Roiling River](../attalya-mountains/taltol-peak/roiling-river.md), and empties into the [Great Seam](../great-seam.md) via [Quench River](../quench-river.md).
