# Middlestag Forest

**Middlestag Forest** is a wooded region along the southern coast of the [Esterfell Sea](esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md). Several settlements of varying sizes surround the wood, but the forest itself has been left undeveloped by the [Esterfell Accord](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md).

## Geography

The forest spans from the base of [Taltol Peak](attalya-mountains/taltol-peak/taltol-peak.md) to the [Open Fields](open-fields.md).

## Etymology

Middlestag is named after a [mythical buck](../../../ch-3-stories-of-mote/pantheons/esterfell-deities/phygius.md) with three antlers that supposedly watches over the forest, acting as its protector against the encroachment of civilization.
