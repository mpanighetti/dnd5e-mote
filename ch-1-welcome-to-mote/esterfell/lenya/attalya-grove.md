# Attalya Grove

The **Attalya Grove** is a narrow strip of forested land hugging the northwestern coast of [Lenya](lenya.md). Its western side faces [Malagwa](../malagwa.md) across the [Strait of Shallows](../waters/strait-of-shallows.md), and to its east lie the [Attalya Mountains](attalya-mountains/attalya-mountains.md) and [Cliffshear Canyons](cliffshear-canyons.md). The towns of [Fleuderton](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/fleuderton/fleuderton.md) and [Perlipont](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/perlipont.md) are surrounded by Attalya Forest trees, having carved out small clearings along the coast.
