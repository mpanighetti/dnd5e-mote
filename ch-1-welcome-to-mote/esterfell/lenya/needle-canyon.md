# Needle Canyon

**Needle Canyon** is a gap between the peaks of the [Attalya Mountains](attalya-mountains/attalya-mountains.md). Its rocky terrain makes the region mostly unsuitable for land development, but the small town of [Needledale](../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/needledale.md) marks the canyon's eastern entrance.
