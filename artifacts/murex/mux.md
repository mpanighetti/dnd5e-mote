# Mux

**Mux** is a corrupted form of [murex](murex.md) occurring after removal from a [murexian creature](../../bestiary/murexian-creature.md). It loses most of its previous value, turning into a highly toxic substance.

## Properties

### Geology

Mux can be found in marshes, streams, and other bodies of water throughout the [Ashen Scape](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/ashen-scape.md).

### Origin and source

Murex turns into mux within 1d4-1 hours of being extracted from murexian creatures (minimum 30 minutes).

### Life and expiration

Mux is shelf-stable.

## History and usage

### Everyday use

When raw murex breaks down into mux, it loses its potential usefulness as a [dye](murexian-dye.md) due to its high toxicity. Some alchemists have been able to use mux as a toxin for poisons.

### Refinement

A vial of mux can be processed with a poisoner's kit into 5 vials of mux poison with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. On a failure, the mux is rendered inert.

### Hazards

Mux exposed to open air emits a harmful vapor within a 20 foot radius. Creatures that start their turn in the vapor must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until they leave the area of the vapor. Sealing the mux within an airtight container also ends the effect.
