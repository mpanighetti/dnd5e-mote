# Dunken

**Dunken** is a small town to the west of the [Floral Divide](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/floral-divide.md) and south of [Frostenfeld](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/frostenfeld.md). It is currently considered part of the [Esterfell Accord](esterfell-accord.md), but the region has switched hands numerous times over the centuries and was under control of [Subros](../subros.md) until a few decades ago.
