## History

Oppo acted as a representative of Sanctus Salimandus when confronted by [Kratos Hammerhand](../../verdancy/citizenry/kratos-hammerhand.md), [Gilfiel Melimane](../../verdancy/citizenry/gilfiel-meliamne.md), and [Drake Olaran](../../../organizations/reynards-den/drake-olaran.md) after the kobolds kidnapped Cindra to make her their queen. Through Drake's use of enchantment magic, Oppo was convinced to take them to Sanctus Salimandus for an audience with their new queen.

Between some political maneuvers, a knock-down-drag-out fight with the kobold guards, and the slaying of an otyugh that had been threatening the kobolds' livelihood for some time, the group was able to convince Oppo and the others to return Cindra to her home in [The Dunes](../cape-bec/the-dunes.md). Cindra knighted Oppo and told him to act as her representative in her absence.
