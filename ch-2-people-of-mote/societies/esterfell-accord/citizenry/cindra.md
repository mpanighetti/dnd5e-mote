## History

The kobolds of Sanctus Salimandus, mistaking Cindra to be a dragon, kidnapped her from her home, took her into the sewers, and appointed her their queen. Eventually Cindra was rescued from captivity by her neighbors [Kratos Hammerhand](../../verdancy/citizenry/kratos-hammerhand.md), [Gilfiel Meliamne](../../verdancy/citizenry/gilfiel-meliamne.md), and [Drake Olaran](../../../organizations/reynards-den/members/drake-olaran.md), who convinced the kobolds that she could continue to act as their ruler from her residence in The Dunes. Cindra knighted [Oppo](oppo.md) and appointed him as her representative in her absence, granting him all necessary decision-making capabilities. The kobolds still visit her regularly through their tunnel to The Dunes, and she happily accepts the company and makes sure to prepare plenty of baked goods for the den.
