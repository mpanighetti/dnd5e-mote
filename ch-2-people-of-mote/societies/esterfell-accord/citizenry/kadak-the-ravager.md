## History

Kadak brought his band of goblin warriors to [Edgewood](../edgewood/edgewood.md) in an attempt to acquire the [blessing of foresight](../../../../ch-5-character-options/supernatural-gifts/blessing-of-foresight.md) from [Adelia](../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/organizations/order-of-istus/members/adelia.md), an acolyte of [Istus](../../../../ch-3-stories-of-mote/pantheons/multiverse-deities/istus.md) who was recently gifted with this blessing. He paid [Gren](../../../c../h-2-people-of-mote/organizations/order-of-istus/members/gren.md) to aid in kidnapping Adelia from the [Middlestag Temple of Istus](../edgewood/middlestag-temple-of-istus.md), as well as obtaining a _wand of secrets_ from the temple's collection of holy relics, having learned from Gren that it could be used to transfer the blessing from one person to another during a stellar confluence. Kadak believed that this divine gift would give him insights into the movements of [Esterfell Accord](../esterfell-accord.md) militia, allowing him to conquer his enemies and seize territorial control over settlements in the Attalya Mountains. Ultimately he was unsuccessful in his effort to obtain this gift, as a search party interrupted the Ritual to rescue Adelia, and [MÃ­rial Windstar](../../../../ch-2-people-of-mote/organizations/the-commune/members/mirial-windstar.md) intercepted Adelia to become the unintended recipient of the blessing.
