# Brier Glen

**Brier Glen** is a village to the south of [Middlestag Forest](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest.md). The town is famous as a destination for the finest teas in [Lenya](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/lenya.md).

## History

The most successful business in Brier Glen is [Tealeaf Estate](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/organizations/tealeaf-estate/tealeaf-estate.md). The Tealeaf family jumpstarted the entire tea industry in Lenya, but competitor families have also started establishing themselves in the vicinity, leading to competition ranging from healthy to cutthroat.

This thriving industry has also spawned a corresponding black market. [Baldwin Marshbluff](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/organizations/gilded-purse/members/baldwin-marshbluff.md) operates the [Gilded Purse](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/organizations/gilded-purse/gilded-purse.md) out of Brier Glen and [Leving](leving.md), and sends regular caravans smuggling stolen tea out of Brier Glen to sell to northern cities.
