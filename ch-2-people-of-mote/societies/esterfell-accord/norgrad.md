# Norgrad

**Norgrad** is a city that sits atop the northern coast of the [Esterfell Sea](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md). The city operates a dam and levee that regulates the flow of water from the open ocean north of [Esterfell](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/esterfell.md) into the Esterfell Sea by way of the artificially created [Norgrad Tributary](../../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/norgrad-tributary.md).
