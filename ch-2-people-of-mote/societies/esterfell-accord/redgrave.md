# Redgrave

**Redgrave** is a small outpost in the [Kari Outskirts](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/kari-outskirts.md). It is the only [Esterfell Accord](esterfell-accord.md) settlement south of the [Floral Divide](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/floral-divide.md), and often acts as a point of contact between the Accord and [Subros](../subros.md).
