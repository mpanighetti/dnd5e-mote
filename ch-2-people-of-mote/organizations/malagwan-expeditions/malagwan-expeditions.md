# Malagwan Expeditions

**Malagwan Expeditions** is an adventuring guild taking jobs along the west coast of [Lenya](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/lenya.md) and across the [Strait of Shallows](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/waters/strait-of-shallows.md) to [Malagwa](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/malagwa.md) and [Barria](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/barria.md). Sellswords affiliated with Malagwan Expeditions operate out of [Fleuderton](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/fleuderton/fleuderton.md), using the [Siren's Shanty](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/fleuderton/sirens-shanty.md) as a base of operations.
