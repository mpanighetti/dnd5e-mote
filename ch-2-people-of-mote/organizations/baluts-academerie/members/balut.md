## History

Balut immigrated to the [Esterfell Accord](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) from [Xiahulia](../../../societies/xiahulia.md) and immediately sought to acquire all the magical knowledge he could from surface-dwelling societies. He quickly excelled in his studies, and soon decided that this bounty of magic needed to be shared with the world and become democratized. With this goal in mind, he founded a school carrying his own name and unique speech patterns.
