# Murexian Dye

**Murexian dye** is a compound derived from [murex](murex.md) that can be used to add a vibrant iridescent purple coloration to textiles, metals, and other materials. The difficulty in obtaining and converting murex makes murex-dyed materials highly valuable, and the supply chain of the dyes themselves is under tight control of the [Esterfell Accord](../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md).

## Manufacturing process

A vial of pure murex can be processed with alchemist's supplies into 5 vials of dye with a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. On a failure, the compound explodes from the vial and deals 2d4 Poison damage to the user.

## Value

- 1 vial: 30pp
