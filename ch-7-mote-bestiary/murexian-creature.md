# Murexian Creature

The peaks of the [Ashen Scape](../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/ashen-scape.md) loom large on the horizon, towering over the plains to the west and separating them from the seas. This mountain range was formed from now-dormant volcanoes as the continent drifted across shifting plates deep beneath the ocean. Though these mountains no longer rain down fiery death upon the lands, the soil was infused with vast deposits of a material known as [murex](../ch-6-mote-treasures/murex/murex.md), from which the [Murexian Grove](../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/murexian-grove.md) sources both its name and its purplish hue.

### Anatomy of a Murexian Creature

Murex exists at all levels of the food chain in the Grove, permeating from the soil to the plants to the herbivores and carnivores, then back into the soil and carrion feeders. Though murex is highly toxic when creatures are exposed to it directly, the denizens of the forest adapt to the murex and incorporate it into their bodies. In addition to the bright purple stripes, spots, rings, and other markings, the murex can cause more extreme mutations. Creatures corrupted by murex will become venomous, injecting deadly toxins into any prey that hasn't adapted to endure murex's effect.

On occasion, these mutations extend to new physiological features such as back and tail frills or bioluminescence. The intensity of the physical mutations increases with higher levels of corruption.

If a creature eats a murexian plant or animal, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become Poisoned for 1 hour.

A plant or animal newly introduced to the Murexian Grove, if not killed and eaten by the deadly venomous predators there, will start to mutate after subsisting on a murexian diet for about one month. Most of the physical changes will last until the creature dies or is removed from the Grove for more than 1d4 days. Constructs, as well as creatures with prior immunity to Poison, are immune to murexian corruption.

### Murexian Corruption Levels

Murexian creatures have varying traits due to the severity of corruption caused by the murex in their systems. The following traits apply to all murexian creatures of given challenge rating thresholds; lower corruption traits also apply to creatures with more severe corruption, unless otherwise noted. In addition, creatures corrupted by murex change their creature type to Monstrosity, unless they already have the Monstrosity or Aberration creature type.

#### Basic Corruption (Challenge 1 or lower)

_**Addled Mind.**_ A murexian creature's Intelligence cannot exceed 13.

_**Contact Poison.**_ If a creature comes into direct contact with a murexian creature's body, it is subject to the following effect. _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 8 + the Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus of the murexian creature. _Failure:_ The target has the Poisoned condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns when it is not in direct contact with the murexian creature, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute without physical contact with the murexian creature, it succeeds automatically.

If the creature already has an effect from contact or melee attacks that includes a saving throw to resist the Poisoned condition, this replaces that feature, but uses the higher of the two DCs.

_**Murexian Immunity.**_ The creature is immune to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition, including those caused by Murexian Poison.

#### Severe Corruption (Challenge 2-5)

_**Enhanced Contact Poison.**_ A creature that fails the Constitution saving throw from a murexian creature's Contact Poison trait additionally has the Paralyzed condition until the end of its next turn.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All attacks and traits of a murexian creature that deal Poison damage or cause the Poisoned condition treat Immunity to Poison as Resistance and ignore a target's normal Resistance to Poison, unless the target has specific Resistance or Immunity to Murexian Poison. Targets with Immunity to Poison or Resistance to Murexian Poison have Advantage on saving throws against Murexian Poison, and targets with Immunity to Murexian Poison automatically succeed on such saving throws.

_**Murexian Venom.**_ The sludge coursing through the veins and fangs of murexian creatures is highly toxic to those who come in contact with them. When a murexian creature hits a creature with an attack using a natural weapon such as a bite or claw, the attack deals an additional 1d6 Poison damage.

#### Complete Corruption (Challenge 6 or higher)

_**Enhanced Venom.**_ The murexian creature's natural weapon attacks deal an additional 3d6 Poison damage (4d6 total) on a hit.

_**Toxic Contact Poison.**_ If a creature that is already Poisoned by murex fails the Contact Poison saving throw from new skin contact, it gains 1 Exhaustion level.

## Example Murexian Creatures

The following creatures are all based on existing creatures and modified with murexian traits based on their original challenge rating (the murexian squirrel is based on a rat). This can serve as an example of how murex corruption affects a stat block. Note that the addition of Poison immunity, contact Poison effects, and increased damage on attacks may increase a creature's challenge rating; an effort has been made to recalculate challenge ratings accordingly, and some attributes have been adjusted to better match the new challenge rating.

### [Murexian Beholder](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/monstrosities/murexian-beholder.md)

It is a strange scenario indeed for a beholder to allow themself to become corrupted by murex. This might occur if the beholder was driven out of their lair and had to flee, finding themself in the Murexian Grove and subsisting on the tainted flesh of the beasts found there to survive. Or it may have been a conscious decision, some play to take in these powerful toxins to use against their real or perceived foes. The ambitions of a beholder are sometimes difficult to predict, and a beholder prefers it this way.

However this came to be, the beholder will find that not only is their body infused with murex, but that their mind is also impacted. The toxins cloud thought and judgment, twisting the beholder's innate paranoia. The aberrant mind becomes more so, reducing the beholder's mental acuity and making them fearful of anything they encounter, thinking that they have discovered an agent of their foes. Such a beholder will generally try to kill creatures on the spot rather than converse or negotiate terms. They still make an effort to anticipate their enemies' next actions, but they become a generally less effective tactician.

Murexian beholders will happily make their new surroundings into a lair, tending to create vast tunnels underground amidst the mexite deposits from ancient volcanic activity. Their slaves dig until they hit magma flows, so that the beholder might better protect their interests through ever more hazardous pathways.

_**Eye Ray.**_ The beholder uses Eye Rays.
