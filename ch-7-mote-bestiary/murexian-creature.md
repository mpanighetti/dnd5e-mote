# Murexian Creature

The peaks of the [Ashen Scape](../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/ashen-scape.md) loom large on the horizon, towering over the plains to the west and separating them from the seas. This mountain range was formed from now-dormant volcanoes as the continent drifted across shifting plates deep beneath the ocean. Though these mountains no longer rain down fiery death upon the lands, the soil was infused with vast deposits of a material known as [murex](../ch-6-mote-treasures/murex/murex.md), from which the [Murexian Grove](../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/murexian-grove.md) sources both its name and its purplish hue.

### Anatomy of a Murexian Creature

Murex exists at all levels of the food chain in the Grove, permeating from the soil to the plants to the herbivores and carnivores, then back into the soil and carrion feeders. Though murex is highly toxic when creatures are exposed to it directly, the denizens of the forest adapt to the murex and incorporate it into their bodies. In addition to the bright purple stripes, spots, rings, and other markings, the murex can cause more extreme mutations. Creatures corrupted by murex will become venomous, injecting deadly toxins into any prey that hasn't adapted to endure murex's effect.

On occasion, these mutations extend to new physiological features such as back and tail frills or bioluminescence. The intensity of the physical mutations increases with higher levels of corruption.

A plant or animal newly introduced to the Murexian Grove, if not killed and eaten by the deadly venomous predators there, will start to mutate after subsisting on a murexian diet for about one month. Most of the physical changes will last until the creature dies or is removed from the Grove for more than 1d4 days. Constructs, as well as creatures with prior immunity to Poison, are immune to murexian corruption.

### Murexian Corruption Levels

Murexian creatures have varying traits due to the severity of corruption caused by the murex in their systems. The following traits apply to all murexian creatures of given challenge rating thresholds; lower corruption traits also apply to creatures with more severe corruption, unless otherwise noted. In addition, creatures corrupted by murex change their creature type to Monstrosity, unless they already have the Monstrosity or Aberration creature type.

#### Partial Corruption (Challenge 1 or lower)

_**Murexian Immunity.**_ The creature is immune to Poison, including those caused by Murexian Poisons.

_**Poisonous Skin.**_ If a creature comes into direct contact with a murexian creature's body, it is subject to the following effect. _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 8 + the Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus of the murexian creature. _Failure:_ The target has the Poisoned condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns when it is not in direct contact with the murexian creature, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute without physical contact with the murexian creature, it succeeds automatically.

Additionally, if a creature eats a murexian plant or animal, they must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become Poisoned for 1 hour.

#### Severe Corruption (Challenge 2-5)

_**Enhanced Poisonous Skin.**_ A creature that fails the Constitution saving throw of a murexian creature's Poisonous Skin trait additionally has the Paralyzed condition until the end of its next turn.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All attacks and traits of a murexian creature that deal Poison damage or conditions treat Poison immunity as Poison resistance and ignores a target's normal Poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistances or immunities to Murexian Poison. Targets with Poison immunity or Murexian Poison resistance have Advantage on saving throws against Murexian Poisons, and targets with Murexian Poison immunity automatically succeed on such saving throws.

_**Toxic Injection.**_ The sludge coursing through the veins and fangs of murexian creatures is highly toxic to those who come in contact with them. When a murexian creature hits a creature with an attack using a natural weapon such as their bite or claws, the attack deals an additional 1d6 Murexian Poison damage.

#### Complete Corruption (Challenge 6 or higher)

_**Toxic Infusion.**_ The Toxic Injection trait deals an additional 3d6 Murexian Poison damage on a hit with attacks using a natural weapon.

_**Venom Surge.**_ A creature that is already Poisoned by a murexian creature's attack or trait and fails the Poisonous Skin saving throw from new skin contact instead gains 1 Exhaustion level. A creature cannot have more than one level of Exhaustion at a time caused by murex.

## Example Murexian Creatures

The following creatures are all based on existing creatures and modified with murexian traits based on their original challenge rating (the murexian squirrel is based on a rat with climbing speed and Pack Tactics added). This can serve as an example of how murex corruption affects a stat block. Note that the addition of Poison immunity, contact Poison effects, and increased damage on attacks can affect the challenge rating; an effort has been made to recalculate challenge ratings accordingly, and some attributes have been adjusted to better match the new challenge rating.

### [Murexian Beholder](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-monsters/blob/main/monstrosities/murexian-beholder.md)

It is a strange scenario indeed for a beholder to allow themself to become corrupted by murex. This might occur if the beholder was driven out of their lair and had to flee, finding themself in the Murexian Grove and subsisting on the tainted flesh of the beasts found there to survive. Or it may have been a conscious decision, some play to take in these powerful toxins to use against their real or perceived foes. The ambitions of a beholder are sometimes difficult to predict, and a beholder prefers it this way.

However this came to be, the beholder will find not only their body infused with murex, but also their mind. The toxins cloud thought and judgment, twisting the beholder's innate paranoia. The aberrant mind becomes more so, reducing the beholder's intelligence and making them fearful of anything they encounter, thinking that they have discovered an agent of their foes. Such a beholder will generally try to kill creatures on the spot rather than converse or negotiate terms. They still make an effort to anticipate their enemies' next actions, but they become a generally less effective tactician.

Murexian beholders will happily make their new surroundings into a lair, tending to create vast tunnels underground amidst the mexite deposits from ancient volcanic activity. Their slaves dig until they hit magma flows, so that the beholder might better protect their interests through ever more hazardous pathways.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All Murexian Poison damage and conditions dealt by the beholder treat Poison immunity as Poison resistance and ignore a target's normal Poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistance or immunity to Murexian Poisons.

See the beholder stat block in the _Monster Manual_ for eye ray effects; the Enervation Ray is replaced with a Murexian Ray which behaves as follows:

**Murexian Ray.** _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 16. _Failure:_ 36 (8d8) Murexian Poison damage, and the target has the Poisoned condition as defined by Venom Surge. _Success:_ Half damage only.

#### Bonus Actions

_**Antimagic Cone.**_ The beholder's central eye emits an antimagic wave in a 150-foot Cone. Until the start of the beholder's next turn, that area acts as an _Antimagic Field_ spell, and that area works against the beholder's own Eye Rays.

#### Legendary Actions

_Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature's turn, the beholder can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The beholder regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns._

_**Eye Ray.**_ The beholder uses Eye Rays.
