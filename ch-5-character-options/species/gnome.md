# Gnome

## Description

**Gnomes** are diminutive humanoids who came to [Esterfell](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/esterfell.md) in the first few waves of immigrations. They spread across all corners of the continent, with larger populations in [Lenya](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/lenya.md) and the [Ashen Archipelago](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/ashen-archipelago.md) and a few families settling in [Barria](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/barria.md) and [Yggru](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/yggru/yggru.md).

## Gnomish ancestries

### [Dust gnome](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-species/tree/main/humanoids/dust-gnome.md)

#### Description

**Dust gnomes** are a lineage of smallfolk with an innate bond to the elements of earth and fire. Their ears are larger and wider than their gnomish cousins, granting them keen awareness of their surroundings.

#### Distribution

The hot stretches of Barrian desert drew in the dust gnomes, who helped establish some of the early populations that founded [Mawlin](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/mawlin.md). These folk can be found in other regions of Esterfell, but they tend to avoid overly humid environments.

#### Traits

- _**Creature Type:**_ Humanoid
- _**Size:**_ Small (2-3 feet tall)
- _**Speed:**_ 30 feet
- _**Skills:**_ Perception, Survival
- _**Senses:**_ Darkvision 60 feet
- _**Life Span:**_ 350 years on average

As a dust gnome, you have the following special traits.

_**Dust Magic.**_ You know the _mold earth_ Cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the _earth tremor_ Spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the _earthbind_ Spell with it. Once you cast either of these Spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a Long Rest; however, you can cast the Spell using any Spell Slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the Spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).

_**Gnomish Cunning.**_ You have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma Saving Throws.

_**Waterdowsers.**_ You are naturally adapted to hot climates. When you are in such an environment, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Wisdom (Perception) checks to forage or navigate within the environment.

### Forest gnome

#### Description

**Forest gnomes** are arboreal people with a connection to the plants, animals, and spirits of the natural world. This magical bond even grants them a limited means of communication with Tiny beasts.

#### Distribution

The temperate forests of Lenya, particularly the [Eastern Forests](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/eastern-forests.md), were a welcoming space to these gnomes, and they helped found clans such as the [Balsam](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/verdancy/balsam.md) and [Eldwin](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/verdancy/eldwin.md).

### Rock gnome

#### Description

**Rock gnomes** originated from deep underneath the largest mountains of Mote. In some corners of the world, the existence of rock gnomes only became common knowledge on the surface when [mountain dwarves](dwarf.md#mountain-dwarf) unearthed them during deep mining expeditions. Their magical connection to stone makes them natural masons, and their desire to know everything about how minerals interact leads many of them to tinkering.

#### Distribution

Though some rock gnomes gravitated toward the mountains of Yggru, many opted instead to contribute to the development of the [Esterfell Accord](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md)'s larger cities. A majority of the engineers and city planners who contributed to grand structures such as a the artificial island on which [Cape Bec](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/cape-bec/cape-bec.md) was founded were rock gnomes. The Ashen Archipelago also has some settlements with larger rock gnome populations, the descendants of tinkerers drawn to the exotic gems and ores found within the dormant volcanic soil.

### Svirfneblin

#### Description

**Svirfneblin** are an Underdark lineage of gnome, leading to them sometimes being referred to as **deep gnomes**. They evolved larger eyes to take in more light in pitch black subterranean environments, and innate psionic abilities common to other creatures of the Underdark.

#### Distribution

Like other Underdark beings, svirfneblin found the dark catacombs of lava tubes under [Mount Hora](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/lenya/mount-hora.md) to be a welcoming space to build and expand their underground settlements.
