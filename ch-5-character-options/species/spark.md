# [Spark](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-species/blob/main/constructs/spark.md)

## Description

**Sparks** are constructed beings that have been imbued with sentience through a magical infusion of [starstuff](../../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md) dust. They have a broad variety of physical builds and appearances, as they were originally purpose-built by Esterfolk tinkerers as laborers.

A spark is distinguished from other constructed beings by the gift of sapience granted to them by starstuff, a technique that has thus far only been utilized in a limited capacity due to the rarity of starstuff on [Mote](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/mote.md) and the poorly understood implications of granting intelligence to artificial beings.

## Distribution

There are no larger societal distributions of sparks, as the nature of their creation and the recency of their invention has not given sufficient time for them to propagate. Most sparks came to sentience at [Balut's Academerie for the Magistically Inclinated](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/organizations/baluts-academerie/baluts-academerie.md) and many still reside at the Academerie or in [Bridgeport](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/bridgeport/bridgeport.md), but some who sought new destinies beyond their original constructed purposes have ventured to other areas of [Lenya](../../ch-4-esterfell-gazetteer/lenya/lenya.md).

## Traits

- _**Creature Type:**_ Construct
- _**Size:**_ Tiny (1-2 feet tall), Small (2-4 feet tall), or Medium (4-7 feet tall), chosen when you select this species
- _**Speed:**_ 30 feet
- _**Resistances:**_ Paralyzed, Poison (**Mechanical Nature**)
- _**Life Span:**_ unknown (immune to magical aging effects)

As a spark, you have the following special traits.

_**Mechanical Nature.**_ Your artificial body grants the following benefits:

- You have resistance to the Paralyzed condition and to Poison.
- You use your Constitution modifier when determining your Armor Class instead of your Dexterity modifier, unless your Constitution modifier is already being added to your AC by another source, such as a Barbarian's Unarmored Defense.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- If the _mending_ spell is cast on you, you can spend and roll one of your Hit Dice to regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).

_**Power Cycle.**_ As a Magic action, you quickly power down your systems and restart them to refresh your body, regaining a number of Hit Dice equal to your Proficiency Bonus. After you take this action, you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.

_**Sentry's Rest.**_ When you take a Long Rest, you spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, instead of sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you remain conscious.

_**Specialized Design.**_ You were originally built to carry out a specific function. You may or may not continue to fulfill this function, but the associated skills remain innately embedded in your form. When you select this species, choose one of the specializations from the **Specialized Design** table to gain the listed traits, including proficiency in either a skill or a tool, and one cantrip. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for cantrips you learn with this trait, and you can cast them without material components. If this trait has an option that spends your Hit Dice, you can spend Hit Dice in this manner a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest.
