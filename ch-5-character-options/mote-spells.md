## Spell Descriptions

The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

### [Kyran's Gambit](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/kyrans-gambit.md)

_Level 1 Abjuration_ (Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Warlock)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of the target's blood, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to drag a creature you touch to another plane of existence to confront them alone. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or both you and the target are banished to a demiplane for the duration. The spell fails if you or the target are prevented from planeshifting.

The demiplane takes on a disturbing appearance of your choice each time you enter it. Damage dealt to a creature in this demiplane that would reduce them to 0 Hit Points instead reduces them to 1 Hit Point. A creature that starts their turn in the demiplane is wracked with pain and mental torment, taking 2d8 Psychic damage. If you are the caster of this spell and take this Psychic damage, the damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way, and it doesn't break your Concentration to maintain this spell.

Once the spell ends, all creatures in the demiplane are returned to their original locations. Removing you or the target from the demiplane also ends the spell.

_**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.**_ The damage dealt by starting a turn in the demiplane increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and the duration becomes 10 minutes (level 5–6 slot), 1 hour (level 7–8 slot), or until dispelled (level 9 slot).

### [Pass Without Note](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/pass-without-note.md)

_Level 2 Enchantment_ (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a scrap of garment common to the current social setting and a dab of makeup applied to your face)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You radiate an aura of irrelevance in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and each creature you choose have a +10 bonus to Charisma checks made to be dismissed or go unnoticed socially, appearing unremarkable and uninteresting compared to other people in the setting. Creatures who fail checks to notice you have difficulty recalling anything noteworthy about your appearance or presence. Creatures who are immune to the Charmed condition ignore the spell's bonus to Charisma checks when making contested checks.
