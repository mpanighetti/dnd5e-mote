## Spell Descriptions

The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

### [Kyran's Gambit](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/kyrans-gambit.md)

_1st-level Abjuration_ (Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of the target's blood which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to drag a creature you touch to another plane of existence to face them alone. The target must succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw or both you and the target are banished to a demiplane for the duration.

The demiplane takes on an appearance of your choosing each time you enter it. Within this demiplane, both you and the target do not age and do not need to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. Damage dealt to a creature in this demiplane that would reduce them to 0 Hit Points instead reduces them to 1 Hit Point. Once the spell ends, both you and the target are returned to your original location. Time appears to flow normally in this space, but if a creature spends more than 1 minute here, no more than 1 minute will have passed in their original plane once they return. The spell's duration is tracked from the perspective of the caster within the demiplane.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, its duration extends to 10 minutes at 2rd level, 1 hour at 3rd level, and 8 hours at 4th level, 24 hours at 5th level, 1 week at 6th level, 1 month at 7th level, 1 year at 8th level, and until dispelled at 9th level. Additionally, when you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell no longer requires Concentration.

### [Pass Without Note](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/pass-without-note.md)

_2nd-level Enchantment_ (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a scrap of garment common to your current setting and a dab of makeup applied to your face)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of irrelevance radiates from you, masking you and your companions from notice in social situations. To casual observers, you appear unremarkable and uninteresting compared to other people in the setting, and they have difficulty recalling anything noteworthy about your appearance or presence. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Charisma checks made to go unnoticed and can't be observed socially except by magical means, such as Divination spells.

Creatures who are immune to the Charmed condition ignore the spell's bonus to Charisma checks when making contested checks to observe the spell's targets.
