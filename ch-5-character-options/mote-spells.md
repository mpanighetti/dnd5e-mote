## Spell Descriptions

The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

### [Kyran's Gambit](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/kyrans-gambit.md)

_1st-level Abjuration_ (Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Warlock)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of the target's blood which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to drag a creature you touch to another plane of existence to confront them alone. The target must succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw or both you and the target are banished to a demiplane for the duration. The spell fails if either of you are prevented from planeshifting by a spell of a higher level.

The demiplane takes on a disturbing appearance of your choosing each time you enter it. Damage dealt to a creature in this demiplane that would reduce them to 0 Hit Points instead reduces them to 1 Hit Point. A creature that starts their turn in the demiplane is wracked with pain and mental torment, taking 2d8 Psychic damage. When you take this damage from the spell, you automatically succeed on your Constitution Saving Throw to maintain your Concentration.

Once the spell ends, both you and the target are returned to your original location. If either creature is removed from the demiplane, the spell ends immediately.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Psychic damage it deals to creatures in the demiplane increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1st. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell no longer requires Concentration.

### [Pass Without Note](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/pass-without-note.md)

_2nd-level Enchantment_ (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a scrap of garment common to your current setting and a dab of makeup applied to your face)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of irrelevance radiates from you, masking you and your companions from notice in social situations. To casual observers, you appear unremarkable and uninteresting compared to other people in the setting, and they have difficulty recalling anything noteworthy about your appearance or presence. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Charisma checks made to go unnoticed and can't be observed socially except by magical means, such as Divination spells.

Creatures who are immune to the Charmed condition ignore the spell's bonus to Charisma checks when making contested checks to observe the spell's targets.
