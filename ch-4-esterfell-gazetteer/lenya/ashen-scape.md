# Ashen Scape

The **Ashen Scape** is a mountain range of dormant volcanoes in northeastern [Lenya](lenya.md). The continental drift that created this terrain is also responsible for the [Ashen Archipelago](../ashen-archipelago.md). Although there are no active volcanoes in the Lenya-bound portion of the range, the grounds are infused with [murex](../../ch-6-mote-treasures/murex/murex.md), a material which causes the purple hue in the soil, plants, and animals of the [Murexian Grove](murexian-grove.md).
