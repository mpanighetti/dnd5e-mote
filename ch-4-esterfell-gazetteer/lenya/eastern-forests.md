# Eastern Forests

The **Eastern Forests** are a wooded region along the eastern coast of [Lenya](lenya.md). The forests extend from the [Ashen Scape](ashen-scape.md) and [Great Seam](great-seam.md) to the southeastern tip of the continent. These woods are considered to be fully within [Verdancy](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/verdancy/verdancy.md) territory and to not be under the rule of the [Esterfell Accord](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) or [Subros](../../ch-2-people-of-mote/societies/subros.md), instead leaving oversight to the individual tribes who call the forest their home.
