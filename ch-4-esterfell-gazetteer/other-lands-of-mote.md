# Other Lands of Mote

The [starstuff](../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md)-infused continent of [Esterfell](esterfell.md) is the setting of many an adventure, but its people cannot lay claim to it as native soil. Every intelligent creature in Esterfell is ultimately descended from people who hailed from other regions, ostensibly on the other side of [Mote](../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/mote.md) but so far removed in time and space as to be almost legendary to modern Esterfolk.

This section describes some of these other lands of Mote from the perspective of a person from Esterfell: as a vague ancestral land with which they have no modern communication or knowledge, ultimately just stories passed down family lines. Venturing beyond the seas of Mote to discover the current state of these lands might form the foundation of its own epic quest.
