# Other Lands of Mote

The [starstuff](../ch-6-mote-treasures/starstuff.md)-infused continent of [Esterfell](esterfell.md) is the setting of many an adventure, but its people cannot claim it as their native soil. Every intelligent creature in Esterfell is ultimately descended from people who hailed from other regions, ostensibly just on the other side of [Mote](../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/cosmology/mote.md) but so far removed in time and space as to be almost legendary to modern Esterfolk.

These nations all sent fleets of ships in response to the starfall, eager to gather new resources in bids for power, but when none of these vessels returned or reported back, the consensus of the times was that the seas were too perilous to navigate, and the ships were written off as lost to terrible beasts or the elements. In truth, though many ships were lost to storms or great monsters, a few did eventually arrive on the shores of Esterfell, founding new nations and societal bonds, but deciding not to attempt the journey again at the risk of further losses. No child of Esterfell has ever returned to their ancestral lands.

This section describes some of these other lands of Mote from the perspective of a person from Esterfell: as a distant realm with which they have no modern communication or knowledge, ultimately a collection of stories passed down family lines. Venturing beyond the seas of Mote to discover the current state of these lands might form the foundation of its own epic quest.

## Atæros

- **Demographics:** dragonborn, dwarf, orc
- **Demonyms:** Atæron

The **Atæron Mining Consortium** was a company formed by multiple wealthy families. The Consortium strip-mined the mountainous region of **Atæros** and traded precious gems and metals to the other nations to build a prosperous empire. All people with full Atæros citizenship, including those born from Atæron parents while out of the country, were considered to be co-partners in the Consortium, granting them an annual dividend paid from the company's profits.

## Dormina

- **Demographics:** elf, fey, gnome
- **Demonyms:** Dorian, Minan, Feyfolk

In ancient times, an elven princess of **Doria** happened upon a [waypoint](../ch-3-stories-of-mote/waypoints.md) and crossed into **Mina** of the Feywild. Within the mirrored forests, she found a pixie imperiled by worgs. The princess slayed the pixie's attackers, and the pixie revealed herself to be the countess of Mina. In gratitude for saving her life, but not wanting to give up anything of value, the countess offered to give the Dorian princess any one item to which she laid claim, but said that she must ask for it without further thought or hesitation. The princess, well-read in fairytales, asked the countess for her heart, and the two were soon wed.

As a result of this unusual transplanar union, the arcanists of Doria and the courts of Mina combined their magical knowledge to construct a great arch to hold open the waypoint, transforming it into a permanent gateway linking the two countries together. In this manner was the cross-worlds kingdom of **Dormina** formed.

## Oshi

- **Demographics:** aasimar, human, halfling, genasi
- **Demonyms:** Oshir

**Oshi** was led by a royal lineage going back over thirty generations. Marriage with Dorian royalty was frowned upon, as it raised concerns of long-lived elf or fey spouses taking the throne when the human sovereign passed away.

## Vekar

- **Demographics:** elf
- **Demonyms:** Vekar

**Vekar** was ruled by King Vekaran, who claimed to be an eternal ruler hailing from the dawn of civilization on Mote. Many doubted Vekaran's claim, assuming the royal house to merely be passing the Vekaran name down over generations, but none were long-lived or brazen enough to safely dispute him.

## Yshun

- **Demographics:** genasi (fire and earth), goblinoid, tiefling
- **Demonyms:** Yshuni

**Yshun** was an atoll stretched around a gigantic volcanic island constantly bubbling with lava. The people of Yshun believed the volcano to be the home of a deity who forged the Yshuni in the fires while in a deep slumber under the lava.
