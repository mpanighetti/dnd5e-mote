#### History

Ramil was once a deva from Mount Celestia who was sent to [Mote](../../mote/mote.md) to oversee the affairs of its mortals, that they all might one day find the path of good. Thinking he could most effectively reach the people of Mote in their dreams, Ramil sung hymns of love and peace, flying constantly around Mote as day turned to night in each region. To the people of the world below, the deva appeared as a shooting star, keeping a constant vigil over Mote and dancing in the skies alongside its [moons](../../mote/moons/moons-of-mote.md), bringing warming light and safety to all.

One day, a large [starstuff](../../artifacts/starstuff.md) deposit fell to the surface of Mote, crashing into the sands of [Barria](../../mote/esterfell/barria.md) and flickering strange patterns at the point of impact. Ramil was drawn to this display and set down on Barria to better understand its meaning. He found that the starstuff had torn into the fabric of reality, creating a rare stable [waypoint](../../lore/waypoints.md) to the Far Realm. Knowing that this plane of existence carried great potential harm to the people of Mote, Ramil flung his white cloak over the portal to block its corruptive influences on the world, taking these strange planar influences into his own body and mind to keep them from the world he loved so. From then onward, Ramil stood as a stalwart guardian against the chaotic psionics that would threaten this plane and all who lived within it, even giving up on his nightly song, knowing that leaving his post would surely mean the end of Mote.

A tribe of [Esterfell](../../mote/esterfell/esterfell.md) humans soon became aware of the loss of celestial music from their dreams, and in their prayers they were led to Barria to witness Ramil's last stand. They saw five towering rocks where Ramil's toes first touched the sands, now the only physical aspect of his presence on this world. They remained in Ramil's presence, and in his honor they formed a society known as [Ramila](../../societies/ramila.md) and a new religion they called [The Chosen](../../organizations/the-chosen/the-chosen.md). In this act of reverence, Ramil ascended as a minor deity of The Chosen. His song reverberates through the minds of his Chosen followers as a faint echo, and they continue to pray for his wellbeing while they seek a Champion who can close the waypoint and save Ramil from his post.

  <summary>SPOILER WARNING</summary>

  Ramil found that he could not indefinitely resist the strange energies emitting from this waypoint, and over time his mind was corrupted by a powerful entity from the Far Realm. This being was once known as Pyr'xhalz, but in possessing the form of a deva, it was able to take Ramil's name by devouring his mind and psyche, and thus it indelibly became Ramil in entirety and eternity, its identity newly rooted in the fabric of reality. The corrupted celestial was given new purpose, that it might act as an entry point to the Material Plane. Ramil soon realized that the Chosen who pledged fealty to it provided a powerful tether to the world of Mote, as starstuff fuels the power of gods through the collective belief of their followers. As Pyr'xhalz was now Ramil, that power was channeled directly to it, and in turn it could fuel its followers with strange psionic abilities while slowly corrupting their minds and waiting for a Champion of sufficient power to set it free upon the world.
