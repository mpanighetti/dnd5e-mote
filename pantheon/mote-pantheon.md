# Mote Pantheon

The **Mote pantheon** is a series of deities sourced from multiple pantheons across the multiverse. Unlike many worlds, [Mote](../mote/mote.md) does not possess a singular pantheon, and each domain is not resided over by only a single god. Instead, an innate magical field powered by the [starstuff](../artifacts/starstuff.md) that permeates all the worlds of [Fellspace](../astronomy/fellspace.md) acts as both divine amplifier and limiter, causing the collective belief of a deity's followers to be their only means of claiming and holding onto a domain.

The term "god" is often used interchangeably on Mote with beings of "lesser" power, including archfey, celestial beings such as angels, and warlock patrons. The origin of such beings has little bearing on their capability to ascend to godhood, as long as they carry a sufficient volume of collective worship.

The following is not an exhaustive list of beings with power and influence over Mote, but represents some specific entities that have been granted full or partial deification by various groups.
