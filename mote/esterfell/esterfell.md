The islands are labeled with their names and are listed here from largest to smallest: Lenya, the roughly trapezoidal central land mass with a circular sea in its top-center, mountains to the west and south, canyons to the northwest and east, purple forests to the northeast, and green regions across its center; Yggru, a heart-shaped island to the southwest covered in icy mountains; Barria, a rhombus-shaped island to the west marked as mostly flat desert land with some small peaks in the lower-left corner; Malagwa, a triangle-shaped cay with a deep lake in its center; and the Ashen Archipelago, some tiny island mountains off the east coast of Lenya near the purple forests." />

## History

### Starstuff impact

Several thousand years ago, the then-unnamed continent was subjected to a massive impact by an asteroid composed entirely of [starstuff](../../artifacts/starstuff.md). The impact rocked the landscape, rapidly reshaping the continent as stellar energies surged through the mountains and forests, while triggering volcanic eruptions and motequakes that could be felt around the globe. These quakes ripped the continent apart into a smaller set of islands. Much flora and fauna was killed instantly at the impact site on Lenya, while survivors within thousands of miles were infused with starstuff fragments empowering their bodies with magical essence and jumpstarting strange evolutionary processes. The asteroid punched deep into Mote's crust, exposing ancient aquifers that rapidly filled the crater and created a new [inland sea](lenya/esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md).

### Settlement

Though Esterfell hosted a diverse ecosystem for millions of years, awakened beings and the discovery of magic were unknown to the continent until the last few millennia. As the motequakes of Esterfell's impact slowly settled, various societies were drawn by the magical pull of the massive deposit of starstuff left behind. These people traveled thousands of miles across empty stretches of ocean, braving treacherous conditions in unsettled seas, suffering many losses, all in the hope of a better life through the bounty of magic and prosperity that such starstuff might provide.

Every group that arrived on Esterfell's shores all those generations ago quickly found land that appealed to their existing sensibilities and climate tolerances; boreal folk gathered in the taiga of the [Kari Outskirts](lenya/kari-outskirts.md), aquatic societies took to the oceans around Malagwa, people attuned to the element of fire settled into the otherwise hostile heat and volcanic ash of [Mount Hora](lenya/mount-hora.md), and so on in that manner. This created a wide distribution of people from many different cultural, genetic, elemental, and planar origins.
