# Murexian Grove

The **Murexian Grove** is a wide stretch of forest land on the northeastern coast of [Lenya](../). Its [plant and animal life](../../../../bestiary/murexian-creature) is unique on the continent due to its uniformly bright purple coloration afforded by the chemical and magical properties of [murex](../../../../artifacts/murex/murex.md), a material which only occurs naturally in the soils of the forest and the surrounding [Ashen Scape](../ashen-scape).

## Fauna and flora

The toxic and chemical properties of murex have diverse effects on plant and animal life in the region. Plants that endure the toxicity of the compound can be twisted and reshaped by it, and similarly pass on these changes up the food chain.

Flora and fauna grown and raised in the Murexian Grove have a uniformly bright purple hue. The murex infusing their physical forms further grants them immunity to poisons, and renders them toxic to non-murexian creatures trying to consume them.
