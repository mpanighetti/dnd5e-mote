# Bathýs-Pela

**Bathýs** and **Pela** form a binary [moon](moons-of-mote.md) system, sharing a double-helix orbit around [Mote](../../mote/mote.md). The two moons orbit between [Kiva](kiva.md) and [Dreg](dreg.md).

## Information

- Orbital period: 8 days (plus [lunar days](../../lore/timekeeping.md#lunar-day))

## Description

The two moons are less spherical than Mote's other satellites, as the centrifugal forces the moons impart on each other from their spiral orbits slightly elongate their shapes.

[Starstuff](../../artifacts/starstuff.md) that falls toward Mote, if not captured directly by Kiva, is collected by the binary moons' gravitational pulls. Such material follows Bathýs-Pela's wakes in a long spiraling trail until Kiva eventually sweeps it up in a future revolution.

## History

### Etymology

"Bathýs" and "Pela" both source their names from a pre-[Esterfell](../../mote/esterfell/esterfell.md) human language; the former means "deep", and the latter is from "pélagos" meaning "open sea".
