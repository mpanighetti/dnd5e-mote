# Kiva

**Kiva** is the largest [moon](moons-of-mote.md) of [Mote](../../mote/mote.md).

## Information

- Orbital period: 28 days (plus [lunar days](../../lore/timekeeping.md#lunar-days))

## Description

Kiva's mass acts as a beacon for incoming [starstuff](../../artifacts/starstuff.md), drawing the material to its surface before much of it can reach Mote. The moon glows faintly but constantly with starstuff energy, causing it to be visible most nights and preventing it from having visible moon phases, although it disappears from view when the smaller [Dreg](dreg.md) eclipses it and negates its glow with antimagic.

## History

### Origin

Many people of Mote have similar creation stories for their world's largest moon. They state that a legendary hero of antiquity named Kiva sought to save Mote from its constant barrage of starstuff. Kiva was said to leap high into the sky, swing her broadsword wide, and cut a swath through the thick blanket of starstuff that surrounded and threatened the world, allowing Mote a safe passage through the heavens. Gradually, as the stories tell, she was covered in layers of starstuff, drawing it to herself so that it might never reach the people of her world. She is thought to continue in this task to the present day, and the moon stands as a lasting testament to her heroism.
