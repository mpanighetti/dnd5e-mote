> Remi, o Remi

> O where could ye be?
>
> I wait by our tree night and day
>
> For Remi, o Remi
>
> You were promised to me
>
> Remi o why hath ye gone away?
>
> ~
>
> Sweet Remi, my Remi
>
> O'er a ten-day gone by
>
> With nary a word nor a sound
>
> In the woods did poor Remi
>
> Fall down and die?
>
> May the [Stag](../pantheon/phygius.md) will that Remi be found
>
> ~
>
> Months without my love Remi
>
> Long gone away
>
> His voice do I hear in the night?
>
> I yearn for my Remi
>
> As the trees bend and sway
>
> Remi o I wish thee by my side
>
> ~
