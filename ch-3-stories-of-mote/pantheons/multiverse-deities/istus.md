# Istus

> "I have one last blessing for you, my emissaries. Your fate is guiding you, not today, not tomorrow, but to a moment that will challenge you in a new and horrible way, and I cannot make the difficult decision that lies at the end of your quest for you, but I can grant you the time you need to make that decision. You're going to be _amazing_."

**Istus** is a deity of divination and fate originating from the world of Oerth. Though she is generally seen as a less-trafficked deity on [Mote](../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/mote.md), she has some followers within the [Esterfell Accord](../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) known collectively as the [Order of Istus](../../organizations/order-of-istus/order-of-istus.md).

To a select few, Istus grants a portion of her power, allowing them the ability to briefly glimpse future events. The most recent direct recipient of this ability was [Adelia](../../organizations/order-of-istus/members/adelia.md). Most seers who receive this gift are members of the Order of Istus, but during certain stellar confluences, a _wand of secrets_ can be used as part of a special ceremony to transfer this ability between individuals (as was done to grant this gift to [Mírial Windstar](../../organizations/the-commune/members/mirial-windstar.md) in Adelia's place). Otherwise, the seer retains this gift until death.
