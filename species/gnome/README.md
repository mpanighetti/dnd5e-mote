# Gnome

## Description

**Gnomes** are diminutive humanoids who came to [Esterfell](../../mote/esterfell) in the first few waves of immigrations. They spread across all corners of the continent, with larger populations in [Lenya](../../mote/esterfell/lenya) and the [Ashen Archipelago](../../mote/esterfell/ashen-archipelago) and a few families settling in [Barria](../../mote/esterfell/barria) and [Yggru](../../mote/esterfell/yggru).

## Gnomish ancestries

### [Dust gnome](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-species/tree/main/humanoids/dust-gnome.md)

#### Description

**Dust gnomes** are a lineage of smallfolk with an innate bond to the elements of earth and fire. Their ears are larger and wider than their gnomish cousins, granting them keen awareness of their surroundings.

#### Distribution

The hot stretches of Barrian desert drew in the dust gnomes, who helped establish some of the early populations that founded [Mawlin](../../societies/mawlin). These folk can be found in other regions of Esterfell, but they tend to avoid overly humid environments.
