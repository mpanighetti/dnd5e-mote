### Description

**Sparks** are constructed beings that have been imbued with sentience through a magical infusion of [starstuff](../artifacts/starstuff.md) dust.

The first sparks started as constructs built by [Esterfolk](../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) tinkerers as beings of burden and labor.
