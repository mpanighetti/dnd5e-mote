### Description

**Sparks** are constructed beings that have been imbued with sentience through a magical infusion of [starstuff](../artifacts/starstuff.md) dust. They have a broad variety of physical builds and appearances, as they were originally purpose-built by [Esterfolk](../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) tinkerers as laborers.

A spark is distinguished from other constructed beings by the gift of sapience granted to them by starstuff, a technique that has thus far only been utilized in a limited capacity due to the rarity of starstuff on [Mote](../mote/mote.md) and the poorly understood implications of granting intelligence to artificial beings.

### Distribution

There are no larger societal distributions of sparks, as the nature of their creation and the recency of their invention has not given sufficient time for them to propagate. Most sparks came to sentience at [Balut's Academerie for the Magistically Inclinated](../organizations/baluts-academerie/baluts-academerie.md) and many still reside at the Academerie or in [Bridgeport](../societies/esterfell-accord/bridgeport/bridgeport.md), but some who sought new destinies beyond their original constructed purposes have ventured to other areas of [Lenya](../mote/esterfell/lenya/lenya.md).

As a spark, you have the following special traits.

_**Mechanical Nature.**_ Your artificial body grants the following benefits:

- You use your Constitution modifier when determining your Armor Class instead of your Dexterity modifier.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- If the _mending_ spell is cast on you, you can spend and roll one of your Hit Die to regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).

_**Sentry's Rest.**_ When you take a Long Rest, you spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, instead of sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you remain conscious.

_**Specialized Design.**_ You were originally built to carry out a specific function. You may or may not continue to fulfill this function, but the associated skills remain innately embedded in your form. When you select this species, choose one of the specializations from the **Specialized Design** table to gain the listed traits. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for spells you learn with this trait, and you can cast them without material components.
