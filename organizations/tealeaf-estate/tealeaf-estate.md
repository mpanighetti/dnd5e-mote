# Tealeaf Estate

The **Tealeaf Estate** is a highly successful family-run business operating out of [Brier Glen](../../societies/esterfell-accord/brier-glen.md). The Tealeaf family specializes in the cultivation of tea, a plant that grows natively in [Yggru](../../mote/esterfell/yggru/yggru.md) but was only introduced to [Lenya](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/lenya.md) in the last millennium by the Tealeaves.

## History

In ages past, the Greenleaf family farmed a broad but generic generic staple of fruits, lettuce, carrots, and tobacco. Around six generations ago, an unfamiliar traveling merchant came upon the Greenleaf farmstead to peddle exotic wares. Among his offerings was an unassuming plant clipping, which the merchant claimed he discovered deep within the peaks of the [Lithbirk Range](../../mote/esterfell/yggru/lithbirk-range.md) and brought to the Greenleaves at great personal risk. The family was dubious of this story, but were intrigued enough by the plant to purchase the clipping. With this purchase, the [chamolith](../../artifacts/chamolith.md) plant was introduced to Lenya, with which the Greenleaves were able to create a novel strain of tea.

Over the next two generations, tea production overtook the farm, and the family name was changed from Greenleaf to Tealeaf. Over the following centuries, the family maintained its dominance on the area's tea production; even though other farms started to compete by stealing chamolith clippings from the Tealeaf farm, none were able to grow the plant in sufficient yields to be directly competitive on the open market. This leads some groups, including the [Gilded Purse](../gilded-purse/gilded-purse.md), to instead steal from Tealeaf wagons along the [Road of Commerce](../../societies/esterfell-accord/road-of-commerce.md) and profit off of sales.
