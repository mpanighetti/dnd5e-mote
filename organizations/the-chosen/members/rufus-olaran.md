## History

Rufus was once betrothed to Líria Kente, who birthed their child Drake in [Tillë](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/tille.md), but her family disapproved of the union, so Rufus parted ways with Líria and took Drake with him to learn the teachings of Deneir.

When Drake was old enough to fend for himself, Rufus once again left his family, this time to try and preach the word of Deneir to the various tribes of [Barria](../../../ch-1-welcome-to-mote/esterfell/barria.md). Rufus had some success in his evangelizing efforts with the [Mawlin](../../../societies/mawlin.md) nomads, but when he spoke to the humans of [Ramila](../../../societies/ramila.md), he was soon swayed by their devoutness to the deva Ramil, and he abandoned both his efforts of conversion and his devotion to Deneir in favor of joining their cult. Now a priest of The Chosen, Rufus furthers the efforts of the Ramilan people and their deva, spreading their beliefs and seeking their future champion.
