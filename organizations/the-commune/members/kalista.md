## History

### Childhood

Kalista grew up among a matriarchal clan of tieflings in the [Esterfell Accord](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md). Her mother was killed when she was very young and she had no memory of her father, leaving her to be raised by distant cousins.

### Adulthood

Kalista and many others from her clan were drawn to a career in the criminal underbelly of the Accord, and she eventually joined [Reynard's Den](../../reynards-den/reynards-den.md) under the watchful eye of [Tybalt](../../reynards-den/members/tybalt.md). The [Ëaruilë](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/earuile.md) chapter of the Den specialized in recruiting tieflings, as Tybalt felt they had been underserved and prejudiced against by people of the Accord.

Kalista currently acts as a field operative for Reynard's Den. She utilizes a raven named Poe to send and receive messages with other Den members. [Olivash](../../reynards/den/members/olivash.md), another agent operating out of Ëaruilë, typically acts as a central contact for such message relays.

Recently, Kalista joined forces with [Alyseris](alyseris.md), [Jedha](jedha.md), [Mírial Windstar](mirial-windstar.md), and [Riordan](riordan.md), originally drawn together under a common cause of rescuing [Adelia](../../order-of-istus/members/adelia.md) from a group of goblins, and later investigating strange occurrences in [Middlestag Forest](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest.md) alongside [Alden Vacker](alden-vacker), [Dex](dex.md), [Ellie Zap](ellie-zap.md), and [Rob Tealeaf](rob-tealeaf.md).
