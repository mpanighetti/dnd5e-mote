Aliana is fairylike in stature with deep purple butterfly wings. Small pointed horns protrude from her forehead up past her hairline, and her fair skin has a faint striped pattern. Her mouth conceals the tiny fangs she and other ithilians bare for exsanguination.

## History

As a princess of Ithilia, Aliana was expected to wed with a partner of her father's choosing, but she opted to follow her heart's desire and instead married her beloved Tamori. Along with her attendant Yira, the couple fled Ithilia to carve out their own destinies. The king eventually put a bounty on Aliana's head to return her to their tree, so she took to the stars of Fellspace to evade capture.

The group's travels eventually led them to [Mote](../../../mote/mote.md), where they found the fledgeling Antipelan Society working to acquire [starstuff](../../../treasures/starstuff.md) and establish a foothold of control over Fellspace. Aliana's travels to other worlds made her a valuable resource to the Antipelans, and her prowess in political maneuverings quickly moved her up the officer ranks until she was granted the role of captain for their prototype [starfire ship](../../../treasures/vehicles/starstuff-ships/starfire-ship.md). Aliana and her crew successfully launched the AP-SF-01 and later christened it the "Sanguine Starcatcher" to reflect the unique relationship with blood of her and other crew members.

Aliana once saved the life of Fionn, who pledged a life debt in repayment.
