# Sanguine Starcatcher

The **Sanguine Starcatcher** (callsign AP-SF-01) is the first [starfire ship](../../../technology/starstuff-ships/starfire-ship.md) built and launched by the [Antipelan Society](../antipelan-society) to prove the efficacy of using [starstuff](../../../artifacts/starstuff.md) as a fuel source for [spelljamming ships](../../../technology/starstuff-ships/starstuff-ships.md).

## Modifications

The Sanguine Starcatcher uses the stat block of a normal starfire ship with the following modifications:

- _**Additional Known Spells.**_ In addition to its default spells, the arcane core knows the following spells:
  - 2nd-level: _locate object_
- _**Engine Hotwire.**_ Assistant Engineer Fibula has implemented an arcane technique from her homeworld known as "hotwiring" in order to allow the starstuff engine to trade off its long-distance jumps for increased maneuverability by burning smaller amounts of fuel in quick bursts. With 8 hours of work, Fibby can hotwire the engine such that its Engine Surge action can, at a cost of 1 starsuff deposit, double the ship's speed until the start of its next turn. This disables the original Engine Surge action behavior, but the change can be reverted with another 8 hours of work.
- _**Long-Range Sensors.**_ Engineer Tenns led a project with the Antipelans to adorn the ship's hull with an array of crystals that allowed it to learn _locate object_ (bypassing a normal restriction preventing the core from learning spells with a range of self) and extend its senses across the ship's surface and into the surrounding space.
