## History

<details>
  <summary>SPOILER WARNING</summary>

  Shorsta is a couatl who was sent to [Mote](../../../mote/mote.md) several millennia ago to oversee the advent of the [Great Astral Confluence](../../../lore/great-astral-confluence.md), a time when mortals would learn to harness the power of [starstuff](../../../artifacts/starstuff.md) to open their minds to the Astral Plane, thereby achieving a transcendence of body and mind. He believes that he has discovered a bloodline of elves that will one day give birth to the one who will trigger this Confluence, and has spent thousands of years subtly guiding historical events and bloodlines toward this event.

  Shorsta and his partner, another couatl named Halasma, travelled alongside the first elves who set foot on [Esterfell](../../../mote/esterfell/esterfell.md), then helped found a monastery on startouched grounds within the [Eastern Forests](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/eastern-forests.md). In the guise of elves, Shorsta and Halasma acted as the monastery's first headmasters, teaching their students to harness their ki and pass their traditions onto future generations. Once the Shorsta-Halasma was established, Halasma felt she had seen her ancient task to completion, and left Mote to explore the stars, but promised to return one day to help further Shorsta's task if needed. Over time, they each made it appear as if they had died of old age, that new leadership could take over and continue their teachings. Shorsta took a new form, this time as a human of [Yggru](../../../mote/esterfell/yggru/yggru.md) named Rovahm, and patiently awaited the Confluence from afar to avoid inadvertently disrupting future events.

  Once the elven bloodline had reached the prophesied generation, Shorsta (in the guise of Rovahm) returned to [Lenya](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/lenya.md) and took a position at the Shorsta-Halasma again, this time as the Master of Shadow, that he could help personally instruct the one he believed would bring about the Great Astral Confluence â€” a young elf named [Dex](../../the-commune/members/dex.md).

Rovahm taught his students advanced stealth tactics and how to tap into the planar power of the Shadowfell. He spent some time personally instructing Dex to eventually succeed him as the Master of Shadow. One day he learned that the Shorsta-Halasma had sinister plans for the student and had given him the task to capture Dex for eventual indoctrination. Distraught at the prospect of seeing his favored student come to harm, Rovahm staged an elaborate ruse: he told Dex that he had been kicked out of the Shorsta-Halasma and to never return, then made it appear to the headmaster as if Dex had fought back and was killed in the process.

Shortly after this incident, Rovahm left the Shorsta-Halasma, feeling that the institute no longer exemplified its original ideals. His position was later filled by [Master of Silence Leaping Frog](leaping-frog.md).
