## History

### Childhood

Dex was born to Gilvaris Rainfall and Yelpetor Ruser in the Eastern Forests. From an early age, Dex showed an aptitude for hand-to-hand combat. His family desired to help him hone his skills through mental discipline, so they enrolled him in the Shorsta-Halasma monastery. Dex excelled in his studies in the ways of shadow and stealth, but his rebellious streak often got him in trouble with his teachers. He believed that this ultimately led to him being kicked out of the monastery, though the true nature of his departure was not revealed to him at that time. Because of this apparent expulsion, Dex has not yet completed the construction of his [staff of Shorsta](../../../artifacts/staff-of-shorsta.md).

### Adulthood
After being kicked out of the Shorsta, Dex wandered the [Verdancy](../../../societies/verdancy) for 8 years before he ran into his mother. She agreed to secretly meet him once a week, and for about 20 years, they did. Yet Dex refused to contact his dad or siblings.

Then, a kobold attack on his old village left his mother extremely weak, and eventually dead. In an effort to avenge her, he tracked the kobolds back to their den, recently exposed by a quarry in the [Open Fields](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/open-fields.md), a cavern collapse left Dex trapped inside. He was soon discovered by [Alden Vacker](../../../societies/verdancy/citizenry/alden-vacker.md), [Alyseris](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/alyseris.md), [Jedha](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/jedha), [Kalista](../../../organizations/reynards-den/members/kalista.md), [Mírial Windstar](../../../societies/verdancy/citizenry/mirial-windstar.md), [Riardon](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/riardon.md), [Rob Tealeaf](../../../organizations/gilded-purse/members/rob-tealeaf.md), and [Rowan Dundragon](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/rowan-dundragon.md). After they helped him escape the den, Dex decided to join the adventuring group as they investigated strange occurrences in [Middlestag Forest](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest.md).
